      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am self-taught developer since 2020, I have built many projects and
        learned multiple skills during that time-frame. The coding industry
        appeals to me because it always encourages learning and keeping up to
        date with new trends and technologies. I truly enjoy discovering new
        languages building new projects. If you are interested in partnering up
        or recruitment just send me a message and I will respond as soon as
        possible.
